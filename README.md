# Example Project for Fixed Timesteps

This is an example project for my Fixed Timestep UE4 fork: https://github.com/0lento/UnrealEngine/tree/4.15-Physics

Project also provides an example on how to run code directly from physics steps using new physics scene delegates included in UE 4.15.

IMPORTANT! This project doesn't work on unmodified UE4!
